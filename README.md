# What it does

This program generates procedural art images. Ideally, the images will be as diverse as possible without sacrificing aesthetics.

An image will contain one to several similar-but-different, ideally complementary, **paintings**, arranged in a **ptych** (from "triptych" or "polyptych").

Outputs are .bmp files, which can be rendered and re-rendered at any resolution based on associated .json files.

The images are based on functions of the XY plane. Ideally, the space of pleasing functions will be covered as widely and evenly as possible.

This is a meta-program in that these functions are generated by mini-programs called **schemes** and **themes**, which are themselves executed and generated by this program, according to the user's direction.

Hence, you can curate outputs at multiple levels: choose which images to save, which themes to save, and which schemes to save.

# How to use it

Understand...
- the relationship between **schemes** and **themes**. Images are created by one **scheme** and one **theme** together. Together, they specify a stochastic (random number-influenced) system for creating images. A **scheme** owns its **theme**—a theme is only associated with one particular **scheme**.
- what a **ptych** is: a whole, final artistic product of one to several related paintings, either rendered as an image (a `.bmp` file in the `images` folder), or unrendered as a "blueprint" for an image at any resolution (a `.json` file in the `ptychs` folder). If you delete the `.json` file, you will not be able to re-render the image.
- the file system. In the `data` folder are the `images`, `ptychs`, `themes`, and `schemes` folders. Look at the former two to see the saved/re-renderable images, and the latter two to see the saved/usable **schemes** and **themes**.

## main commands

<br>

### re-render

You can re-render an already-produced image at a specified resolution (representing the longer side of the paintings within the ptych). Use a double-quote mark:

`" 2000` will re-render the last shown image at 2000 pixels.

`" abc 2000` will re-render the saved image called "abc" (leave off the extension) at 2000 pixels.

<br>

### explore images

You can run and re-run a scheme+theme combination ad infinitum, producing a new image each time, saving the ones you like.

`butterfly alpha` will generate and show a new image with the scheme called "butterfly" and its theme called "alpha".

` ` (just leave the command blank) will generate a new image with whatever scheme and theme were last used. This will be your most used command.

<br> 

### explore themes

You can specify a scheme and (repeatedly) direct the program to find a new theme for it, saving the themes you like. Of course, to test each theme, you will probably want to run the scheme+theme combination several times, and may want to save some of those images as well.

`butterfly` will find a new **theme** for the **scheme** called "butterfly".

`?` will find a new **theme** for whatever scheme was last used.

<br>

### explore schemes

You can specify nothing, and (repeatedly) direct the program to find a new scheme, saving the schemes you like. Of course, to test each scheme, you will probably want to 

`??` will find a new **scheme** with a new, appropriate **theme**, and generate and show a new image created by them.

<br>

### interrupt scheme/theme search

Using default settings, searches for **schemes** and **themes** should produce a result in seconds. That said, if the search is taking too long, press ``ctrl+C`` to interrupt it and enter a new command.

<br>

### quit

`#` will quit the program.

<br>

### manually composed schemes/themes

There are functions in the `art_scheme.py` file where a user can manually compose a **scheme** and/or **theme**. However, this is difficult, and the program is not finalized enough for the effort to be worth it. Hence, the following types of commands will be of no use and should be avoided:

`++` will generate and show a new image with the manually composed **scheme** and **theme**.

`+?` will find a new theme for the manually composed **scheme**.

`butterfly +` will use the manually composed **theme** for the saved scheme called "butterfly".

<br>

## save commands

After generating anything (a re-rendered old image, or a new image/**scheme**/**theme**), you will be prompted to save the new content—first the image, and then the **scheme**/**theme** (if applicable).
