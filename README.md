What it does

This program generates procedural art images. Ideally, the images will be as diverse as possible without sacrificing aesthetics.

An image will contain one to several similar-but-different, ideally complementary "paintings", arranged in a "ptych" (from "triptych" or "polyptych").

Outputs are .bmp files, which can be rendered and re-rendered at any resolution based on associated .json files.

The images are based on functions of the XY plane. Ideally, the space of pleasing functions will be covered as widely and evenly as possible.

This is a meta-program in that these functions are generated by mini-programs called "schemes" and "themes", which are themselves executed and generated by this program, according to the user's direction.

Hence, you can curate outputs at multiple levels: choose which images to save, which themes to save, and which schemes to save.


How to use it

Understand the relationship between schemes and themes. Images are created by one scheme and one theme together. Together, they specify a stochastic (random number-influenced) system for creating images. A scheme owns its themesâ€”a theme is only associated with one particular scheme. That's all you need to know.

Lowest level commands: resolutions. You can re-render an already-produced image at a specified resolution (representing the longer side of the paintings within the ptych). Use a double-quote mark:

`" 2000` will re-render the last shown image at 2000 pixels.
`" abc 2000` will re-render the saved image called "abc" at 2000 pixels.

Low level commands: images. You can run and re-run a scheme+theme combination ad infinitum, producing a new image each time, saving the ones you like.

`butterfly alpha` will generate a new image with the scheme called "butterfly" and its theme called "alpha".
`` (just leave the command blank) will generate a new image with whatever most recent scheme and theme were used. This will be your most used command.

Medium level commands: themes. You can specify a scheme and repeatedly direct the program to find a new theme for it, saving the themes you like. Of course, to test each theme, you will probably want to run the scheme+theme combination several times, and may want to save some of those images as well.

High (exploring schemes): You can specify nothing, and repeatedly direct the program to find a new scheme, saving the schemes you like. Of course, to test each scheme, you will probably want to 
You can specify nothing and direct the program to find a new scheme,
